# JS-and-CSS-Clock

This was a personal project that I completed in order to improve my vanilla JavaScript ability. 

The goal was to create an analogue clock, digital clock and stopwatch. I have applied my own personal spin with the design, which is an acquired taste. 

This was created when I was relatively new to JS so I want to come back and refactor the code, but please take a look and clone if you wish to see how it works.
